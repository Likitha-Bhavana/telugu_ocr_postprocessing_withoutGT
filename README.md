# 📝 Telugu OCR Post-Processing Tool (Without Ground Truth)

This web app processes raw Telugu OCR output without needing ground truth. It corrects low-confidence or invalid Telugu words using a frequency-based dictionary and edit distance logic.

## ✅ Features

- Automatically separates valid vs. invalid Telugu words
- Uses edit distance and word frequency to correct misspellings
- Summarizes how many words were corrected, skipped, or marked valid
- Outputs a downloadable `.txt` file with corrections and status

---

## 📂 Input Format

You need to upload **two `.txt` files**:

### 1. OCR Output File (e.g., `ocr_input.txt`)

Each line should be in the format:

predicted_word confidence_score


**Example:**

మనము 0.92

తెనుగు 0.85


---

### 2. Telugu Dictionary File (e.g., `combined_telugu_dictionary.tsv`)

A TSV (tab-separated) file with two columns:

word frequency


**Example:**

మనము 1532

తెలుగు 5021

## 🖨️ Output Format

The app provides a downloadable file with the following columns:

Prediction PostProcessed Probability CorrectionStatus


At the end of the file, a summary is included:

======== SUMMARY ========

✅ Total entries: 2000

🟦 Corrected Telugu entries: 321

🟢 Valid Telugu entries: 1421

⚠️ Skipped impure/invalid entries: 258


---

## ⚙️ How It Works

- Words that are not in the dictionary and have low confidence are corrected.
- Correction is based on **minimum edit distance** and **maximum frequency**.
- High-confidence words or those with non-Telugu characters are left unchanged or skipped.
